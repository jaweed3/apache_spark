# Apache Spark Learning Repository

Dedicated for analysis data with Apache Spark, Project Based learning. Free to Contribute!

This repository is dedicated to learning and experimenting with **Apache Spark** for distributed data processing. It covers various concepts, including RDDs, DataFrames, SparkSQL, and machine learning with SparkML.

## Features
- Hands-on examples with Apache Spark.
- Covers RDDs, DataFrames, and SparkSQL.
- Machine Learning with Spark MLlib.
- Works with local and cluster setups.
- Uses **Conda** for environment management.

## Installation
Make sure you have **Conda** installed to set up the environment properly.

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/apache-spark-learning.git
cd apache-spark-learning
```

### Create and Activate the Conda Environment
```bash
conda create --name spark_env python=3.11.0
conda activate spark_env
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Install Apache Spark
Download and install Apache Spark:
```bash
wget https://downloads.apache.org/spark/spark-3.3.0/spark-3.3.0-bin-hadoop3.tgz
tar -xvzf spark-3.3.0-bin-hadoop3.tgz
export SPARK_HOME=$(pwd)/spark-3.3.0-bin-hadoop3
export PATH=$SPARK_HOME/bin:$PATH
```

## Running Spark Shell
To start Spark in interactive mode:
```bash
pyspark
```

## Running Example Scripts
Execute a sample Spark script:
```bash
spark-submit examples/basic_rdd.py
```

## Topics Covered
1. **Introduction to Spark**
2. **RDD (Resilient Distributed Datasets)**
3. **DataFrames & SparkSQL**
4. **Transformations & Actions**
5. **Machine Learning with MLlib**
6. **Streaming with Spark Streaming**
7. **Deploying Spark on a Cluster**
